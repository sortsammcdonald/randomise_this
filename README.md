# randomise_this

Simple script to generate URLs for random categories and interviews within those categories from the [usesthis blog](https://usesthis.com/).

You can run this on your own machine if you put the files in a [Giter8 template](https://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/) and run this on Scala's sbt.
